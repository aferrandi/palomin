# Palomin

Palomin is a simple game, based on an old VIC20 game copied from a magazine, that I will use to teach programming to my daughters.
The game is written in Elm, because this language is simple and concise.

The game challenge is to avoid all bombs and eat all fruits on the screen.

It is a structurally simple game, The only complex section of code is the one that generates random values, being Elm a functional language. 

The plan is to: 
* start with a simple skeleton of an Elm program 
* add the state (man, bombs, fruits)
* add a textual version of the view
* add the keys handling
* add the random values creation
* add the rest of the game logic
* use a graphical version of the view
